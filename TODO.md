    - [ ] Create account with balance (add initial balance transaction)
        - Remember to delete it when deleting the account
        - You probably need to add "type" column to the transaction db with "initial balance", "transfer", "simple".
        - You will probably need Enum for that
    - [ ] Add `account/untracked` to measure transactions without accounts. Do the same for the other classes
